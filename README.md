# Matlab-Adaptive-Median-Filter
 An adaptive median filter performs spatial processing to reduce noise in an image. The filter compares each pixel in the image to the surrounding pixels. If one of the pixel values differ significantly from the majority of the surrounding pixels, the pixel is treated as noise.
